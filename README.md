# Homework2-P
This code is represents my initial portfolio page. It includes a small section about me, a project section which includes filler content for the time being, and my contact information. There is nav bar to scroll to the different sections. 

The site has been designed using mostly flex display. Media screen has been used to adjust some elements for better viewing at different screen sizes. 

Screenshot of finished work can be seen below:
